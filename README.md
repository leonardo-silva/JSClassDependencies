# JSClassDependencies
This work represents an approach to infer class dependencies, such as "associations" and "uses", in legacy JavaScript programs. We combine the results of two tools <a href="https://github.com/aserg-ufmg/JSClassFinder">JSClassFinder</a> and <a href="http://flowtype.org">Flow</a> to infer the dependencies. We evaluated our approach on two open-source systems transpiled from TypeScript to JavaScript.
We make "the oracle" available in this repository to enable the replication of our study.
